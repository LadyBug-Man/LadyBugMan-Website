# LadyBugMan-Website 
The Primary goal of this was to make my own webpage to have links to other website/social media's of mine
instead of using a service like linktree. It has been a great project to get me started learning HTML, CSS and Java.

As I learn more in this field I will add more features to the website. 
My current future plans are:
- [ ] Custom made Dark/Light mode
- [x] Mobile compatibility

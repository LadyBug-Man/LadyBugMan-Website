                                Hey there, I'm LadyBug-Man and In my spare time, I like to make and share things, And this is the place where you can find all of it.
                                A few of my favourite types of projects include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Music</li>
                                    <li>Art</li>
                                    <li>Electronics</li>
                                    <li>Games</li>
                                    <li>Coding</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br>
                                I have been making games on and off for the better part of 15 years, Mostly recreating mechanics I saw in games I loved 
                                and wanted to figure out how developers may have gone about it. I used Unity3d for this and learned a lot, But now I am fully devoted to 
                                learning the Godot environment lately.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Learning to code through video games led me to discover Electronics and how to code micro-controllers like the Arduino. I spent many years making 
                                random projects for fun and my own home convenience. Even going so far to make a very early home automation assitant I called "PIR-Ce" (Percy). This was before smart home
                                devices were common.
                            </p>

                                In 2023 I begun learning how to make/produce my own music. What started as an endeavour to make simple
                                ChipTunes for a project I was working on at the time turned into a newfound love and creative pursuit. 
                            </p>

                                And very recently I delved into the craft of websites. Taking me back to my highschool days of making projects in Adobe Dreamweaver (RIP).
                                Re-learning HTML and CSS since has been surprsingly difficult but in the best way as I love figuring code out, 
                                plus integrating the little Java I knew has been fun!
